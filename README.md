Setup Instructions

Clone the Repository:git clone https://github.com/Venkata-Sreenivas/My_Resume.git


Navigate to the Project Directory:cd your-repo-name


Open the Project:
Open index.html in a web browser to view the landing page locally.
Alternatively, use a local server (e.g., Live Server extension in VS Code) for a better development experience.


File Structure:your-repo-name/
├── index.html           # Main HTML file
├── style.css           # CSS styles
├── public/
│   └── contact.html    # Contact page (linked in navigation)
├── assets/
│   └── icon/           # Social media icons (LinkedIn, Instagram, GitHub)
└── README.md           # This file


Assets:
Ensure the social media icons (linkedIN.png, instagram_logo.jpg, Github.webp) are placed in the assets/icon/ directory.
Update the paths in the HTML if the icons are stored elsewhere.



Hosting
The project is hosted on GitHub Pages. Access it at:

My Resume
About Me

To host on GitHub Pages:

Push the repository to GitHub.
Go to the repository settings, enable GitHub Pages, and select the main branch (or gh-pages if preferred).
The site will be available at https://Venkata-Sreenivas.github.io/My_Resume.

Customization

Colors: Modify the CSS variables in :root (e.g., --primary-color, --bg-gradient) in style.css to change the color scheme.
Content: Update text in index.html (e.g., hero section, testimonials, FAQs) to reflect your personal or project details.
Links: Replace external links in the navigation and gallery with your own URLs.
Forms: The contact and newsletter forms require backend integration (e.g., Node.js, PHP, or a service like Formspree) to process submissions.

Known Issues

The contact and newsletter forms are static and need a backend to handle submissions.
The alt attributes on gallery links should describe the link content, not the project (e.g., alt="Link to My Resume").
The contact.html file referenced in the navigation is not provided; ensure it exists in the public/ directory or update the link.

Future Improvements

Add JavaScript for form validation and submission handling.
Implement lazy loading for social media icons to improve performance.
Add more interactive elements, such as a carousel for the gallery or testimonials.
Enhance accessibility (e.g., ARIA labels, keyboard navigation).
